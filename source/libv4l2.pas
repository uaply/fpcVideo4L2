{ Just like your regular open/close/etc, except that format conversion is
  done if necessary when capturing. That is if you (try to) set a capture
  format which is not supported by the cam, but is supported by libv4lconvert,
  then the try_fmt / set_fmt will succeed as if the cam supports the format
  and on dqbuf / read the data will be converted for you and returned in
  the request format. enum_fmt will also report support for the formats to
  which conversion is possible.

  Another difference is that you can make v4l2_read() calls even on devices
  which do not support the regular read() method.

  Note the device name passed to v4l2_open must be of a video4linux2 device,
  if it is anything else (including a video4linux1 device), v4l2_open will
  fail.

  Note that the argument to v4l2_ioctl after the request must be a valid
  memory address of structure of the appropriate type for the request (for
  v4l2 requests which expect a structure address). Passing in NULL or an
  invalid memory address will not lead to failure with errno being EFAULT,
  as it would with a real ioctl, but will cause libv4l2 to break, and you
  get to keep both pieces.

  the actual range of the given v4l control id, and then if the cid exists
