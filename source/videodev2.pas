{
  Most part of this file was converted by H2Pas 1.0.0 using 'h2pas -e -p videodev2.h'
  Some defines in videodev2.h which could not be implemented without functions was commented out.
  Anonymous unions were converted to named pascal unions with name 'u'.
  All V4L2_PIX_FMT_* and VIDIOC_* constans were prepared with another custom script.
  Note also manual insertions of 'packed record' and platform-dependent 'unsigned long userptr'.  
  Files 'v4l2-common.inc' and 'v4l2-controls.inc' are concatenated to this one.

  If you need to update this file you can try to compare provided 'videodev2.h'
  with a new version and update changes manually.
  Or you can try to run 'h2pas' again and compare result with this unit.

     Although std_id is 64 bits, there is an issue on PPC32 architecture that
     makes switch(__u64) to break. So, there's a hack on v4l2-common.c rounding
     this value to 32 bits.
     As, currently, the max value is for V4L2_STD_ATSC_16_VSB (30 bits wide),
     it should work fine. However, if needed to add more than two standards,
     v4l2-common.c should be fixed.
